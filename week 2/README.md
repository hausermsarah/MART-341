# Assignment 2
### by Sarah Hauser

This is my **readme** for week 2! The image I have uploaded is one I use for my *Vtuber* when I stream, and the photo is for most of my social media! I like it a lot and think it's cute! A friend of mine had drawn it for me. Here is the [link](https://www.twitch.tv/hauserbowser) to my stream if you want to check it out!

Here are a few things I like to do on stream!
1. Play games such as Team Fight Tactics and Valorant
2. Play wordle
3. Just chat and talk with stream
