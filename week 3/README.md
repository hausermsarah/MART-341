# Assignment 2
### by Sarah Hauser

This is my **readme** for week 3! I made a mistake and accidentally did *week 3* last week, so I am just typing new stuff for this week! I keep getting the weeks mixed up; whoops!

Here are some reasons I'm smarter than accidentally doing this week twice!
1. I am coding a video game with some friends in a team of 8!
2. Play wordle
3. I understand coding pretty well! I take classes on it in my free time
4. I made a moving gif this time!
