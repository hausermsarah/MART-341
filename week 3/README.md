# Assignment 2
### by Sarah Hauser

This is my **readme** for week 3! I made a mistake and accidentally did *week 3* last week, so I am just typing new stuff for this week! I keep getting the weeks mixed up; whoops!

Here are some reasons I'm smarter than accidentally doing this week twice!
1. Play games such as Team Fight Tactics and Valorant
2. Play wordle
3. chat and talk with stream
